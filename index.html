                I'm a software developer. I work with <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> and <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor.js</a>, along with a host of other technologies including React, Redux, Elixir, AWS, Mapbox, and D3, to name just a few.
                <br><br>
                My latest project, <a href="https://sightlinemaps.com">Sightline Maps</a>, is a platform for easily 3D printing topographical maps, primarily for the U.S. Military.
                <br><br>
                I also launched a tutorial site for the Phoenix Framework cleverly named <a href="https://www.learnphoenix.io">LearnPhoenix.io</a>. I think Phoenix has the potential to be the new standard for highly-concurrent, distributed web applications (though it has applications outside of web as well).

            As mentioned above, <a href="https://sightlinemaps.com">Sightline Maps</a> is a platform for 3D printing topographical maps. The target customers are military and special operations, but we have also found applications in education, mountain climbing, oil exploration, and a variety of environmental groups.

              The Sightline Maps frontend was originally built with Meteor.js and Mapbox for the most part. Our backend was a Python/Flask server which handled all of our image processing. Meteor.js handled the frontend, user authentication, purchases, and was our primary interface for our Flask API.

              We recently rebuilt our app with a new stack: React + Lambda + Phoenix. We published a <a href="#">blog post</a> describing the transition in more detail. The short version is that our app is mostly serverless now and we can handle an almost unlimited amount of traffic thanks to AWS Lambda and Phoenix.

            The Phoenix Framework is built on Elixir and Erlang and is meant for highly-concurrent, distributed applications. It's mostly used for web apps, but it's also great for other use cases (see the awesome <a href="http://nerves-project.org/">Nerves Project</a> for more info). I built a tutorial site in which you learn how to build an extensible Intercom-style chat application for communicating with potential customers.

              The app is built as a statically-hosted React/Redux frontend with a Phoenix JSON API as the backend. It's an intermediate-advanced level tutorial series, so you'll have to at least be comfortable with functions and libraries before you get started.

            CampaignHawk
          </h3>
          <p>
            I started working on an <a href="https://github.com/samcorcos/campaign-hawk">open-source</a> campaign management app, which I have given the working title "CampaignHawk". It's built with Meteor and React and makes ample use of Mapbox for the data overlays.
            <div style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">
              <div style="width:40%;padding-right:20px;">
                The data you're looking at to the right is a basic implementation of the built-in clustering algorithm used by Mapbox as well as some turf.js functions and color scaling with D3. The first shows all voters in the district; the second shows the district divided into precincts and colored based on political orientation; the third filters out unlikely voters.
                <br><br>
                Every step of the process from navbar to data layer toggling is documented in a <a href="https://medium.com/@SamCorcos/building-campaignhawk-an-open-source-election-canvassing-app-with-meteor-and-react-part-1-aff5e8e19a32">series of 22 articles</a> on Medium. I'm planning to write a few more on testing with Cucumber at some point.

            Tinder Clone
          </h3>
          <p>
            For my first React-Meteor project, I thought it might be fun to make a clone of Tinder in as few lines as possible. The final app ended up around 150 lines of JavaScript. It's not especially impressive, but developers who are new to mobile seem to like it. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/samcorcos/meteor-react-ionic-tinder-4">here</a> and a working demo can be found <a href="http://tinderclone.meteor.com/">here</a>. I suggest trying it out using the mobile emulator in your Chrome dev tools.
            <div style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">
              <div style="width:40%;padding:5px;">
                <img src="tinder.gif" alt="">
              </div>
              <div style="width:60%; padding-left: 20px;">
                The stack is Meteor-React-Ionic, but I'm really only using Ionic for the Sass. Most of the complicated parts of this project are in the CSS animations and positions.
                <br><br>
                Here's what is happening in the app:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fake data is generated using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/Faker">Faker</a>, and the data is put into an <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/#cards">Ionic Card</a>.</li>
                  <li>React listens for a touch event and moves the card along with your finger by tracking the X and Y coordinates of the event.</li>
                  <li>If the end point of the touch event (when you lift up your finger) is within 50 pixels of an edge, another event is triggered (like or dislike).</li>
                </ul>
                This was also build back in the days when Meteor and React didn't work particularly well together, so it would actually take even less work if one were to replicate this app today.

          <p>
            When I was in high school, I worked at the oncology center at UC Davis for two summers and co-authored a paper titled:
            <br><br>
            <a href="#">Sequence-dependent of apoptosis from green tea polyphenol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) plus cisplatin (CDDP) in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells</a>
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately, the red tape and the politics of medicine turned me off to the field. It was a fascinating project and I hope to get involved in basic research again someday.
